# react-native-yelp-clone
clone of yelp app using react-native and yelp api

You must first obtain a valid api key from yelp. Once you've received a valid api key, you need to make a secret directory after clone at the same level as the App.js.

Inside the secret dir, create a file: yelpToken.json in the format similar to:

{
    "key": "Bearer REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_VALID_API_KEY_FROM_YELP"
}
